-- Reads developer-actor (exception) entries from the unified audit_logs table. Shape
-- mirrors the old developer_logs table so DeveloperController + DeveloperLogDto keep
-- their contract. ErrorHandlingMiddleware writes exceptions with actor_type='System'
-- and event_type='Exception', packing severity/message/stack/path/method/status into
-- the metadata JSON; both paths are included via the UNION-style WHERE clause.
